//Message by Melissa: this cell is the collection view cell you see when you have tapped the "create" button in the detailed view you get after tapping one of the results in the search tab. (ex: Results --> Tapping on the results (either from collection view or table view --> Detailed View of venue --> Press the create bar button item --> the view where you can add a tip and create a new collection OR add this venue to an existing collection (this is where this collection view cell would be used)
    //This subclasses from VenueCollectionViewCell because in the gifs, they look exactly the same (they have the venue image, same labels at the bottom, but this cell will also have a "+" image on top of the venue image to indicate that the user can add it to existing collections)

class AddCollectionTipViewCell: VenueCollectionViewCell {
    
    //to do
        //create initializer
        //create the properties (like image view, labels, etc.)
        //create another image view that is of the "+" image and this image view will have a very translucent (low alpha value) background and the "+" image as the image property
        //set up constraints
        //maybe set up configure cell?
